1. Is there a fault in the program? If so, locate it and explain.

2. Define a test case that does not execute the fault. Start from this question, 
if it is possible, you should give the test case (the attendance record with 10 values), 
the expected output and the actual output. If impossible, explains the reason. Besides, 
you should implement the complete program, including the functions under test, 
and verify your inputs along with their corresponding outputs.

3. Define a test case that executes the fault but does not result in an error state.

4. Define a test case that results in an error state but not a failure.

5. Define a test case that results in failure.
